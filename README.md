## This is the data of my website
I got tired of hosting companies (last one was a VPS Linode), their crappy customer support and losing files. Now I host my website on GitHub (so I can have access to it from anywhere).

I wrote about how I moved my websites [in this article](http://alexcican.com/post/guide-hosting-website-dropbox-github).
